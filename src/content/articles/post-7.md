# Building a Simple AI Widget for Article Interactions

In today's fast-paced world, not everyone has time to read entire articles. Many readers just want a quick summary or simple explanation. While there are many AI-powered solutions out there, most require running your own backend server or managing API keys. I wanted something simpler.

## The Problem

- Readers often want quick summaries or explanations
- Running your own AI service is complex and expensive
- Managing API keys and backend servers is a hassle
- Most solutions are overcomplicated for basic needs

## The Simple Solution

Instead of building a complex system, I created a lightweight widget that leverages existing AI services that people already use. The idea is simple:
1. Let users select text they're interested in
2. Provide options like "Summarize" or "Explain Simply"
3. Open their preferred AI service (ChatGPT or Claude) with the text pre-loaded
4. Let the AI service do the heavy lifting

## How It Works

Here's the core of the implementation:

```typescript
const AI_SERVICES = [
  {
    id: 'gpt',
    name: 'ChatGPT',
    url: 'https://chat.openai.com'
  },
  {
    id: 'claude',
    name: 'Claude',
    url: 'https://claude.ai/chat'
  }
];

const AI_ACTIONS = [
  {
    id: 'summarize',
    title: 'Summarize',
    emoji: '📝',
    prompt: 'Please provide a clear and concise summary of the following text:'
  },
  {
    id: 'explain',
    title: 'Explain Simply',
    emoji: '🎯',
    prompt: "Please explain this text in simple terms:"
  }
];

function handleServiceSelect(serviceId) {
  const service = AI_SERVICES.find(s => s.id === serviceId);
  const action = selectedAction;
  if (!service || !action) return;

  const text = selectedText || getArticleContent();
  const prompt = `${action.prompt}\\n\\n${text}`;
  
  if (service.id === 'gpt') {
    // ChatGPT supports URL parameters for auto-execution
    window.open(`${service.url}/?q=${encodeURIComponent(prompt)}`, '_blank');
  } else {
    // For other services, use clipboard
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(prompt);
    showNotification('Prompt copied! Please paste it in the AI chat.');
    window.open(service.url, '_blank');
  }
}
```

## Why This Approach?

1. **No Backend Required**: We don't need to run our own servers or AI models
2. **No API Keys**: We leverage services users already have access to
3. **Simple Maintenance**: Just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no dependencies
4. **User Privacy**: All interaction happens directly between the user and their chosen AI service
5. **Always Updated**: As AI services improve, our widget automatically benefits

## Benefits for Readers

- Get quick summaries of long articles
- Understand complex topics with simple explanations
- Use their preferred AI service
- No need to copy-paste text manually
- Works with any part of an article they select

## Future Ideas

While keeping it simple, we could add:
1. More AI services as they become popular
2. Additional prompt templates
3. Keyboard shortcuts
4. Custom prompt options

## Conclusion

Sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution. Instead of building a complex system with its own AI backend, we created a lightweight widget that connects readers with the AI services they already use and trust.
