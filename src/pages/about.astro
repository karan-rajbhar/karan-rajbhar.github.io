	<h2>About  💻</h2>
	<p>I'm a software developer who loves building applications that solve real problems for users. I'm passionate about creating tools and solutions that make people's lives easier and more efficient. Currently, I work as a Software Developer at Treety 🌳, where I focus on building meaningful digital experiences.</p>
	<h2>Personal 🌟</h2>
	<p>I'm based in India 🇮🇳 and have a few hobbies that keep me busy outside of work. On weekends, you'll often find me playing cricket 🏏. I also enjoy writing ✍️ in my spare time and love watching cat videos 🐱 (they never get old!). When I want to unwind, I like to game 🎮 and spend time exploring new things that catch my interest.</p>
